# Using NextJS and TailwindCSS

Welcome to my first tutorial, in this blog I am going to be going over how to setup a NextJS project and TailwindCSS.

## What is NextJS?

NextJS is a JavaScript framework built by Zeit. Allowing the developer to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React. With just some basic knowledge of ReactJS you can jump straight into NextJS. 

After installing NextJS a simple `npm run dev` and your web application is up and running. 

## What is TailwindCSS?

TailwindCSS is a CSS framework that helps to build website faster and more easily. You can use classes to build custom designs instead of the traditional way of writing CSS. This makes writing CSS much faster and we don't need to come up with name for our CSS classes because the CSS is writen straight into the `className`. It is also very easy to make the website responsive using TailwindCSS.
