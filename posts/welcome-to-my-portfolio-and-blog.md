# My first blog Post!

This website is a simple personal portfolio that I am using to document all my work, projects, what I'm working on or anything interesting I find!

## Blog
In this blog, I am simply going to be writing about all the things I've learnt , experienced , my current and or upcoming projects. In conjunction with any blog I make I will post a YouTube video. This just means that any video I post on [Coding Kermit](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAUm8tYx-kd1IWtdbW7RYA) will have a blog accompanying it. These could consist of programming tutorials , new tech stack and or anything interesting in the tech or cyber space that I find. This is all still very new to me and is a new experience for me to experiment with. I am still trying to find my niche and the direction I would like to take both this blog and the YouTube channel.

## YouTube 
As I previously mentioned I will be staring a YouTube channel. The name of the channel is [Coding Kermit](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAUm8tYx-kd1IWtdbW7RYA). On here I will be I will be producing programming , various tech tutorials and even some tech news down the line as I progress. Like I said I will be experimenting and seeing how I enjoy making content for the YouTube platform. Not only this but connecting with all of you and hearing your opinions and ideas. Suggestions for tutorials and videos of your own will be greatly appreciated as it will give me a chance to try other things and hear new ideas.

## Moving forward
I am going ot be using a combination of my Blog, YouTube, and my GitHub to be showing off my work and research that I am completing. I am currently working on various NFT projects and am planning on writing a few blogs on my progression as a web3 developer. Along with this I am going to making a YouTube video and blog on how to create a site in NextJS, which is what my portfolio is written in.

I hope you stick around for the long journey ahead!
