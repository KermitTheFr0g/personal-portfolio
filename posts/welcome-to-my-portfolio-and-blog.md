# My first blog Post!

This website is a simple personal portfolio that I am using to document all my work, projects, what I'm working on or anything interesting I find!

## Blog
In the blog I am simply going to be posting blogs about anything I've learnt, what I'm currently working on and I am going to post a blog in conjunction with any YouTube videos that I post. This means that any of my YouTube videos which will be posted to [Coding Kermit](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAUm8tYx-kd1IWtdbW7RYA) will have a blog to go with the video, this could be for a programming tutorial, new tech stack or anything interesting in the tech or cyber space that I find. This is something very new to me so I am still trying to find my niche and the direction I would like to take both my blog and my YouTube channel.

## YouTube
As I mentioned along with the blog I am also going to be starting a YouTube channel called [Coding Kermit](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAUm8tYx-kd1IWtdbW7RYA) this is where I am going to be producing programming, any tech tutorials, and even some tech news down the line. This is very experimental and I would like to see how these come out and if I enjoy making the content for the YouTube channel. Any suggestions for tutorials or videos that I could post would also be greatly appreciated.

## Moving forward
I am going ot be using a combination of my Blog, YouTube, and my GitHub to be showing off my work and research that I am completing. I am currently working on various NFT projects and am planning on writing a few blogs on my progression as a web3 developer. Along with this I am going to making a YouTube video and blog on how to create a site in NextJS, which is what my portfolio is written in.

I hope you stick around for the long journey ahead!
