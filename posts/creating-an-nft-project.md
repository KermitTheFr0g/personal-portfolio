# Working on an NFT Project

In this blog I am going to be discussing the process or creating an NFT project from scratch. The tools and languages that I was required to learn for the project and how I went about learning these tools and languages. 

## Tools and Languages

Throughout this experience I have learnt some extra technologies that are going to help with my everyday programming and web development not just for NFT development. These are NextJS and TailwindCSS, both of these speed up development of efficient and effective web apps.
