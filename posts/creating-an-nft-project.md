# Working on an NFT Project

In this blog I am going to be discussing the process or creating an NFT project from scratch. The tools and languages that I was required to learn for the project and how I went about learning these tools and languages. 

## Tools and Languages

Throughout this experience I have learnt some extra technologies that are going to help with my everyday programming and web development not just for NFT development. These are NextJS and TailwindCSS, both of these speed up development of efficient and effective web apps. Solidity was the other language that I have had to learn in order to build the smart contract for the project. I will go more into detail about what this is later on.

Although I had previously used React these were all new concepts to me so not only did I need to learn how to use NextJS and TailwindCSS but also the concepts of a smart contract and how an NFT works. 

The research that has occured in the background of this project is was intense and has taken as much time as the coding and development of the project itself. In order to ensure that the development was smooth and the end product was good for the end-user and secure.

## Research

There is a lot of research that has gone into the project, not only research into tools and technology. A lot of research into the workings of NFTs and the blockchain, how these worked and how other projects also operated. Although others in the project understood how to operate with NFTS and how they worked I wanted the most understanding before even beginning to look into the requirements for the project.

This insisted in a lot of YouTube videos and reading medium articles. 

Now moving onto the project itself, there were a few requirements for me as a developer. I needed to create the imagery (I will go more into this shortly), create a responsive site, and also write the smart contract to allow people to mint the NFTs. These all need to then be connected together to ensure that a user is able to mint an NFT from our own site.

Explain in basic terms what and how an nft works...

## Process of developing a project

There are a few main stages for developing the project, of course your project could differ from how I have moved through the stages of mine. The first stage of the project was to create the imagery. In order to do this I had multiple layers for the images, an example for this is the head, body, and some sort of accessory. A random item from each of these layers needs to be chosen to then create a new image all looking slightly unique. This was easy to accomplish simply by using [HashLips Art Engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine). This allowed me to configure the items that were more rare and output both the meta data and the images into two seperate folders, ready to be uploaded to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This is a decentralised file system which is where the images and metadata is stored.
