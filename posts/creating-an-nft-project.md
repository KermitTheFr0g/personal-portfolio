# Working on an NFT Project

In this blog I am going to be discussing the process or creating an NFT project from scratch. The tools and languages that I was required to learn for the project and how I went about learning these tools and languages. 

## Tools and Languages

Throughout this experience I have learnt some extra technologies that are going to help with my everyday programming and web development not just for NFT development. These are NextJS and TailwindCSS, both of these speed up development of efficient and effective web apps. Solidity was the other language that I have had to learn in order to build the smart contract for the project. I will go more into detail about what this is later on.

Although I had previously used React these were all new concepts to me so not only did I need to learn how to use NextJS and TailwindCSS but also the concepts of a smart contract and how an NFT works. 

The research that has occured in the background of this project is was intense and has taken as much time as the coding and development of the project itself. In order to ensure that the development was smooth and the end product was good for the end-user and secure.
